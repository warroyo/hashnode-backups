# About Me

Hey! I am Will Arroyo.

I am a Solution Engineer at VMware living in Denver and working on all things Cloud Native with a heavy focus on Kubernetes.

In the past, I have helped build large-scale infrastructure automation systems as well as helped modernize software deployments across enterprises.

I am also passionate about cooking and food in general so you may see some posts about food mixed into this blog.
